# Statistical Machine Learning: Regression & Spam Detection

## Project Summary

This project uses **Statistical Machine Learning (SML)** to solve two different kinds of problems: predicting numbers (regression) and sorting things into categories (classification).

*   **Regression Problem:** We used polynomial regression to find the right balance between a model that's too simple (underfitting) and one that's too complicated (overfitting).
*   **Spam Detection Problem:** We compared different models to see which one is best at identifying spam emails: LDA, QDA, NaÃ¯ve Bayes, and FLD.

We used different methods to see how well our models worked: cross-validation, ANOVA, error analysis, and ROC curves.
